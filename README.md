## Getting Started

### Basic Installation

__Disclaimer:__ _This command is going to execute a shell script, you should never do something like this without inspecting the source code first._

__Prerequisites:__ _macOS._

```shell
curl -#L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgerke/dots/master/install | sudo bash
```

## ~/. files

This iteration is a slightly different take on my https://github.com/cgerke/dotfiles repo that was based on the awesome work by @mathiasbynen

This dot files strategy simply stores all my "dot files" in my iCloud Drive Desktop folder, which I then symlink to my ~/ root.

I find it convenient this way since, immediately after login, I will be presented with a README.md file and install script.
